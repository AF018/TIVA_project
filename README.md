# TIVA_project
TIVA Project : Eigenfaces
Compression and recognition of faces

Most of the code including the pca comes from the repository : https://github.com/bytefish/facerecognition_guide

We are using the AT&T database ( http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html ) and the database assembled by Dr Libor Spacek ( http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/mv/allfaces/index.html )
